      Parikshit is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Parikshan’, which means
      ‘testing’. The Project started in 2010 with the goal of increasing student
      industry link, contributing to the country’s space program and making
      Manipal Institute of Technology a respected center for space technology.
      Under the constant guidance of various scientists from the ISRO Satellite
      Centre (ISAC), Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) and a panel of
      faculties of MIT, critical milestones have been cleared to launch our
      first satellite. As a research project we have presented more than 50
      technical papers worldwide.
      <br />
      The process is carried out in a state-of-the-art laboratory that has
      facilities like the functional Parikshit Ground Station(PGS) which can
      track satellites in orbit. There is also a clean room for testing and a
      soldering room for circuit prototyping and testing.
